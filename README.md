### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Wiem Ben Elhaj, currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Quality Systems Engineering at Concordia University, an AI consultant and R&D specialist deeply invested in the fascinating world of Generative AI. My passion lies in exploring the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their transformative impact across industries. From building evaluation pipelines for LLMs to researching cutting-edge techniques like fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, Iâ€™m dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI.

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work on innovative AI solutions that address real-world challenges. My technical expertise spans MLOps tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Kubeflow, and I enjoy leveraging these tools to create scalable, production-ready AI systems.

Iâ€™m driven by the goal of democratizing access to AI, making complex technologies like Generative AI more accessible and impactful. If you're as excited about the future of AI as I am, letâ€™s connect and explore how we can collaborate to shape this rapidly evolving field.

Let's embark on a journey of innovation, where every conversation counts and every line of code makes a difference. If you have an exciting opportunity or simply want to exchange ideas, feel free to reach out.
